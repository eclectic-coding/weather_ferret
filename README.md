# WeatherFerret

Welcome to `Weather Ferret`. What is a Ferret? Yes, of course, a little furry animal, but to _ferret_, also, means to "`look around in search of something`." This gem provides you with a command-line application that lets you query for a weather forecast by providing a location. It uses the [Dark Sky API]() to access both the current conditions, and an extended eight day forecast. The user has the option to get further details on any of the days provided. Happy ferreting!

## Pre-Installation Setup  
This application uses the `Dark Sky API` to retrieve the weather forecast. Before using `Weather Ferret`, you will need to acquire your API Key. The API is free for the first 1,000 calls per day and so you will find this very generous for your use. 

Go to the [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev) and sign up for your key. 

After you have your key, you will need to create a `.env` (notice the DOT in the file name) in the root of the project. Inside the `.env` file add the following line of code:

```cassandraql
DSKY_API_KEY=YOURKEYHERE
```
The `.env` is already added to the `.gitignore` file so if you fork this project, it will not be uploaded to your repository. 

Happy Ferreting!


### Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'weather_ferret'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install weather_ferret

### Usage

The program workflow is as follows:
- When the program starts the user is asked to enter a location.
- The user is asked to verify their response.
- The responses is validated. 

After the data entry and validation, `Weather Ferret` contacts two API's
- First, using a gem called `Geocoder`, it converts the location to coordinates (latitude and longitude). 
- Second, via a gem called `Forecast_IO`, which is a wrapper for the Dark Sky API, displays a set of information (see screenshot below):

The user can select to exit the application or view more details:

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

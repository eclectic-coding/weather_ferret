## TODO: Future Features   
This is a running list of features on a wish list to integrate:   
1. Add caching to `Geocoder` to limit the amount of API calls to convert locations to coordinates.
2. Add custom weather emoji's based on the `icon` field from `Dark Sky API`.
3. Add settings feature to handle units instead of hard coding them (i.e. mph vs. kmp, F vs. C)
4. Add caching to `Forecast_IO`

### Supported Icon Tags in Dark Sky 

* clear-day
- clear-night
- rain 
- snow 
- sleet
- wind 
- fog 
- cloudy 
- partly-cloudy-day

## TODO: Future Features   
This is a running list of features on a wish list to integrate:   
1. Add caching to `Geocoder` to limit the amount of API calls to convert locations to coordinates. Plan to use `CSV` or possibly `SQLite`
2. Add custom weather emoji's based on the `icon` field from `Dark Sky API`.
3. Add settings feature to handle units instead of hard coding them (i.e. mph vs. kmp, F vs. C)
